# Spam_Message_Detection_Using_Naive_Bayes

A Python implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm for detecting spam messages. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of the Naive Bayes classifier in distinguishing between spam and non-spam messages.

## About

This project uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify messages as spam or non-spam. It includes the preprocessing of text data, feature extraction using the bag-of-words model, and model training and evaluation on a dataset of SMS messages.

## Key Features

1. **Naive Bayes Algorithm Implementation**: An implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm, showcasing its application in text classification tasks.
2. **Spam Message Detection**: The ability to classify messages as spam or non-spam with a high degree of accuracy.
3. **Text Preprocessing**: Includes steps such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming to clean and prepare the text data for classification.
4. **Feature Extraction**: Uses the bag-of-words model to convert text data into numerical features that can be used by the Naive Bayes algorithm.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The project includes code for evaluating the classifier's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Cross-Validation**: Implements cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and to prevent overfitting.
7. **Live-Data**: We can give our input message and check whether the message is spam or not.
